# VR-final-project
this was our final project for COMP 454: Virtual and Augmented Reality

It is a VR escape room set in a school with puzzles that have randomly generated answers so no two playthroughs are the same.

I worked as a Gamplay System designer / 3d artist making some models that werent on the asset store and writing the main gameplay loop system of the game.
